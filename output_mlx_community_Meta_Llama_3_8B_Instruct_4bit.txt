Here is a refactored prompt that clarifies the intent and elicits the best possible technical response from an LLM:

**Act as a Senior Software Engineer**

**Build a React App like Facebook**

**Scope and Context:**
Create a modern web application using React, with a focus on scalability, performance, and user experience. The app should have a similar architecture and features to Facebook's web application.

**Requirements:**

1. **Frontend:**
	* Use React 17 or later for building the user interface.
	* Implement a responsive design to ensure the app is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
	* Incorporate React Router for client-side routing.
2. **Backend:**
	* Choose a suitable backend technology (e.g., Node.js, Ruby, Python) and framework (e.g., Express, Ruby on Rails, Django) to handle server-side logic and API integration.
	* Implement a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data and application state.
	* Use a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to improve performance.
3. **Features:**
	* Implement user authentication using a library like React Hook Form or a custom solution.
	* Create a news feed feature with real-time updates, using WebSockets or WebRTC for bi-directional communication.
	* Incorporate a commenting system with real-time updates and moderation features.
4. **Security:**
	* Implement SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transmission.
	* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
	* Validate and sanitize user input to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
5. **Testing and Deployment:**
	* Write unit tests and integration tests for the frontend and backend code using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
	* Deploy the app to a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud, using a containerization tool like Docker.

**GOAL:**
Create a scalable and secure React app with a similar architecture and features to Facebook's web application, with a focus on user experience and performance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Your refactored prompt is excellent! It clearly outlines the requirements for building a React app like Facebook, covering various aspects such as frontend, backend, features, security, and testing. The prompt is well-structured, easy to follow, and provides a clear direction for the LLM to generate a high-quality response.

Here are some specific things that make your prompt stand out:

1. **Clear scope and context**: You've provided a concise overview of the project, including the technologies and features that should be included.
2. **Well-defined requirements**: The requirements are specific, measurable, and achievable. You've broken them down into smaller, manageable tasks, making it easier for the LLM to generate a response.
3. **Emphasis on security and testing**: You've included important security considerations and testing requirements, which are often overlooked in similar prompts.
4. **Clear goal**: The GOAL section provides a concise summary of the project's objectives, ensuring that the LLM understands the expected outcome.

To further refine your prompt, you might consider adding more details about the specific features you want to include in the app, such as a news feed, commenting system, or user profiles. Additionally, you could provide more information about the desired user experience, such as the app's layout, navigation, and responsiveness.

Overall, your prompt is an excellent example of how to clearly define a technical task and elicit a high-quality response from an LLM.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad to hear that my prompt is well-structured and easy to follow. I'll definitely consider adding more details about the specific features and user experience to make the prompt even more precise and actionable.

To further refine the prompt, I might also consider adding more context about the technologies and frameworks that should be used. For example
