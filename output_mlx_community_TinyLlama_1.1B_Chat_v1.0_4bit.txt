I do not have the capability to build a react app like facebook. However, I can provide you with a general guide on how to build a react app like facebook.

1. Choose a framework:
there are several popular react frameworks available, such as react, react native, and angular. Choose the one that best fits your project requirements and development style.

2. Set up a development environment:
install and configure your preferred development environment, such as node.js, npm, and a web server like apache or nginx.

3. Create a basic react app:
create a new react project using one of the available react cli tools, such as create-react-app or create-react-app-with-typescript.

4. Install dependencies:
install the necessary dependencies for your project, such as react, react-dom, and any other dependencies required for your project.

5. Create a basic react component:
create a basic react component that represents the main functionality of your app. This component should contain the logic for displaying the user interface and handling user input.

6. Connect the component to the react-router:
connect the component to the react-router, which will handle the routing and navigation of your app.

7. Add styling and design:
add styling and design to your app using css or any other preferred design tool.

8. Test and deploy:
test your app thoroughly and deploy it to a production environment.

9. Continuous integration and deployment:
continuous integration and deployment (ci/cd) is a process of automating the build, test, and deployment of your app. Use a tool like gitlab, travis-ci, or jenkins to automate your ci/cd process.

10. Monitor and optimize:
monitor your app's performance and optimize it for better user experience. Use tools like google analytics, uptimerobot, or pagerank to track your app's performance and make data-driven decisions.

in conclusion, building a react app like facebook requires a good understanding of react, react-dom, and other dependencies. By following the above steps, you can create a basic react app that is similar to facebook's user interface and functionality.
